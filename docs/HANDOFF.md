# HANDOFF.md — Session Context for Cold Start

Last updated: 2026-06-09
Source: Claude web chat session covering V1.3 → V2.7

This file captures decisions, context, and reasoning that cannot be inferred from the codebase alone. Read this before making architectural decisions.

## Current State (after V2.7)

### System Capabilities
- Full quote lifecycle: import → product library → search (cross-category) → preview (with health warnings) → export (customer/internal mode) → history search → reuse
- Image extraction from .xlsx (zip + drawing anchors) and .xls (LibreOffice conversion)
- Multi-column merge import (V1.9): specs spread across Power/Voltage/CCT/etc. columns get merged into Product Details
- Price cleaning: strips $, ¥, currency suffixes during import; V2.7 fix: ¥ symbol priority in mixed spec+price cells
- Non-data row skipping: sub-headers in data area auto-detected and skipped
- Quote session management: auto-clear after export, "新建报价" button
- Same-currency auto-detection: exchange rate auto-sets to 1 when currencies match

### Data
- Products: 1,751 across 29 categories
- Supplier offers: 2,392
- Imported from: ~110 files
- CTN coverage: ctn_qty 795 / L×W×H 666 out of 2,392 offers
- Price timestamps: 54% (1,293 offers with price_updated_at)
- Product images: 341 products have images

### Data Sources on Disk
- `/Volumes/My Passport/AI 报价/发客户报价单汇总` — customer quotation summaries by category (98 Excel files)
- `/Volumes/My Passport/AI 报价/各家工厂最新报价汇总` — factory quotations by factory (1,613 Excel files)
- ~1,000 PDF files (not parseable by current system)

---

## Key Decisions Made (with reasoning)

### Carton Size: L/W/H three separate fields, not one combined string
- Decided over template analysis showing customer needs L/W/H in separate columns
- `ctn_size` (legacy field) kept but not written to by new imports
- Volume calculated at export time: L×W×H/1,000,000 m³

### MOQ: store raw, clean at export
- DB keeps original string ("1000/色", "500PCS")
- Export-time `cleanMoq()` extracts leading digits
- Preserves source data fidelity

### Price semantics: only import factory RMB prices
- The 80MB summary file (`核价 Welfull ... 给南美客户 汇总.xls`) contains FOB USD = customer prices, NOT purchase prices
- Importing FOB USD as purchase_price would double-count margin
- RMB columns (单价/含税) in that file are derived from factory source files
- Primary data source = individual factory quotation files in category folders, not the summary file

### Product images: .xlsx zip extraction, .xls via LibreOffice
- SheetJS free version cannot extract images
- .xlsx: unzip → xl/media/ → xl/drawings/ anchor XML → row mapping
- .xls: `soffice --headless --convert-to xlsx` → then same path
- Thumbnail: 300px max width, JPEG, stored in `data/images/`
- `products.image_path` stores thumbnail path

### V2.0 definition: "daily internal use ready"
- NOT "ready for non-technical end users" (needs Tauri packaging)
- NOT "all data imported" (only ~4% of files imported)
- Acceptance: user can complete a real customer quote workflow in <30 minutes without terminal (except npm run dev)

### Data import strategy: quality over quantity
- Don't import all 2000 files blindly
- Each category needs: newest factory quotation file with RMB prices
- ~50-100 files are actually needed, not 2000
- Import in layers: high-frequency categories first, others on demand

### Two import directories have different price semantics (confirmed V2.7)
- `发客户报价单汇总` = customer-facing quotes, prices are FOB USD (sale price). Do NOT batch-import as purchase_price.
- `各家工厂最新报价汇总` = factory quotations, prices are RMB (cost price). This is the correct source for supplier_offers.purchase_price.
- V2.7 imported 30 files / 37 sheet entries from the second directory with strict price column verification.

### parsePriceValue ¥ symbol priority (V2.7 bugfix)
- Cells like "15000MA ¥282.5" contain spec numbers before the RMB price
- Old parser extracted first number (15000), new parser extracts first number after ¥ (282.5)
- Cells without ¥/￥ keep original behavior

## Version History (this session)

| Version | What | Key Decision |
|---|---|---|
| V1.3 | CTN three-column split + export template match | Template is authoritative over AGENTS.md text |
| V1.8 | Quote preview/confirmation | Server action for preview (ExcelJS can't go in client bundle) |
| V1.9 | Import enhancement (multi-column merge + price cleaning) | descriptionColumns: number[] replaces descriptionColumn: number |
| V1.10 | Real acceptance + cross-search selection fix | Preview "bug" was cross-origin (127.0.0.1 vs localhost), not code bug |
| V2.0 | MVP milestone | 8 acceptance criteria, all passed |
| V2.1 | Batch import 25 categories + price_updated_at | Category from folder name, not sheet name; model_no conflict = reuse product |
| V2.2 | Quote session cleanup + data quality tools | Auto-clear after export; product library quality filters |
| V2.3 | Product identifier cleanup | Wall light temp model_no → customer-readable names (done by Codex independently) |
| V2.4 | Duplicate audit + Type A/B split | Don't merge same-spec products (may differ by photo) |
| V2.5 | Quote history search/detail/reuse | Reuse uses CURRENT prices, not snapshot |
| V2.6 | Product image extraction | .xlsx zip + .xls LibreOffice conversion path |
| V2.7 | Second directory batch import + parsePriceValue bugfix | Only import factory RMB prices, never FOB USD; ¥ symbol priority fix; 471 new products, 328 images auto-extracted |

## What's Next (not started)

### Immediate Options (pick based on user feedback)
1. **V2.8 数据质量审计** — 品类合并（地插灯/太阳能壁灯 → 太阳能壁灯）、重复 offer 清理、脏款号修正（model_no="/"）
2. **Batch image backfill** — re-scan source files for pre-V2.7 products without images
3. **V2.7 review 文件补导** — Step 1 标记 review 的 20+ 文件需 importer 增强（合并单元格、多阶梯价）
4. **Price version tracking** — supplier_offers.price_updated_at exists but no update-vs-create flow
5. **Git init** — 项目无版本控制，需初始化

### Not Now
- PDF parsing (V3.0, high effort, uncertain value)
- AI text extraction from descriptions (not needed while structured import works)
- Multi-user auth (single user tool)
- Customer entity management (V3.1)

## Working Rules

- Always backup DB before data scripts: `cp prisma/dev.db backups/dev-before-{task}-{date}.sqlite`
- Data cleanup pattern: read-only audit → user confirmation → backup → apply → post-audit → tests
- For naming/identifier changes: show before/after examples BEFORE writing to DB
- Codex task instructions: always include Step 0 checkpoint (report current state, wait for confirmation)
- Source Excel files are NEVER modified, moved, renamed, or deleted
- Schema changes use raw SQL + sqlite3 (Prisma schema-engine has empty error bug on this Mac)

## Workflow Migration

This is the first session using a structured handoff. Previous sessions used ad-hoc handoff documents:
- `docs/claude-opus-handoff.md` (V1.7 → V2.0 context)
- `docs/claude-sync-v2.4-from-v2.2.md` (V2.2 → V2.4 context)

Going forward:
- This HANDOFF.md is the single source of session context
- CLAUDE.md defines Claude Code Opus's role and permissions
- AGENTS.md remains the project rules and constraints reference
- Task instructions go in `docs/codex-task-*.md`
